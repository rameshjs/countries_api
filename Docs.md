# GLOBAL COUNTRY DATA PROVIDER
Get information on any country, from population and languages to currencies and more via restful api.

# ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This open-source project draws inspiration from restcountries.eu and restcountries.com. While the original project has transitioned to a subscription-based API, and the second project lacks a robust filtering or structured means of querying country data, I am actively addressing these issues with the aim of enhancing the accessibility and usability of this project.

# COUNTRY DATA
